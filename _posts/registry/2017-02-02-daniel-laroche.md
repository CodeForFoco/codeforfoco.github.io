## Dan LaRoche

Hi all, I'm a software engineer looking to contribute to my community and stretch my coding legs. I live in Old Town and love the idea of mozying over to help develop the next cool thing for our fair city. Talk to me about programming, computer hardware, video games, hiking, A/V, or anything else! And definitely join!
