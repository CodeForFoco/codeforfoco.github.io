## Armando Flores Ibarra

I'm a Java Developer currently working in a project for USDA. I've been coding for around 17 years. I have good experiencie
both in the back end (Java EE 5, 6, 7) and front end development (JSF2/PrimeFaces). I've done a little Visual Studio/C# too.

I'm  <a href="https://github.com/afibarra">@afibarra</a> on Github and <a href="https://twitter.com/afibarra">@afibarra</a> on Twitter.
