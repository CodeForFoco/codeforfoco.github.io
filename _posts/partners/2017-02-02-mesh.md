Mesh is a cool place to come up with the next big thing. Formerly Galvanize, it is located in the heart of Old Town Fort Collins at 242 Linden St, Fort Collins, CO 80524. With plenty of individual and group work space, Mesh creates the perfect environment for public service projects like Code for FoCo.
