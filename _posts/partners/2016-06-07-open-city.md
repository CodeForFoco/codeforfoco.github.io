OpenCity is a City of Fort Collins initiative to take transparency to the next level. The goal of OpenCity is to create a web portal to host data sets that are available to the public in a format that citizens can easily search, filter, and utilize in innovative and creative ways. Making data available allows citizens to learn about the City, help make decisions, and be a part of creating solutions.
