## What is an ideal CFFC project?

Code for Fort Collins is a small volunteer organization. As such, our best projects have a few core things: a relaxed timeline, some clear reason that a volunteer wants to work on them, and a single or small group of stakeholders who will help us solve problems and market the project.

Things that make them even better: evidence they will be successful and impactful if used (and thus a clear set of eager users), a vision about why people will use the project, and some funds available to cover costs for us.

## What if I'm not sure? Or want help anyway?
