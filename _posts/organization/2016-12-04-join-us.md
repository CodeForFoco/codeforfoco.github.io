## Join Code for Fort Collins

Code for Fort Collins (Code for FoCo) is the first northern Colorado brigade of the [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/). Code for America brigades are independent groups that work to improve their community by building technologies and capacities why they feel will help the city and area in which they reside.

Code for Fort Collins has existed since July of 2016. We've been meeting regularly since the summer of 2016, and are proud that our first project was for the [Fort Collins Bike Coop](http://fcbikecoop.org/).
