David and Andrew letter of intent to participate in [Innovate Fort Collins](http://www.fcgov.com/environmentalservices/innovate-fort-collins.php) was approved! There's still a lot more to be done, the next step is the application process. The project, Reclaim Fort Collins, seeks to reduce waste and promote reuse by providing an easy means for people to exchange goods.

Fort Collins Scorecard is a new project who's aim is create an up-to-date web-based data visualization tool for tracking solar contributions with respect to City of Fort Collins 2015 [Climate Action Plan](http://www.fcgov.com/climateaction/). The city's action plan seeks to reduce emissions 20% below 2005 levels by 2020, 80% below 2005 levels by 2030 , and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. This project is being done with the help of [Sandbox Solar](http://www.sandboxsolar.com/).
