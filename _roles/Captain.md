A Captain is the term we've chosen for "brigade leader". 

## A Captain has the responsibility to...

* **Lead brigade meeting and (in so doing) pro-actively identify and solve issues arising across the brigade.** This means identifying emerging needs, promoting new leaders, and helping keep everyone involved with the brigade productive and engaged. (This role is further elaborated in Meeting_Leader.)
* To that end, **captains serve as a project-manager-of-last-resort for all brigade projects.** This means that they should be at least superficially aware of each project, it's status, and needs.
* **Attend meetings, communicate in Slack, and generally be available and responsive to communications.** While there aren't hard requirements, a Captain should attend meetings as much as they can, ideally no less than once per month. When not in attendance, they should continue to support and communicate with brigade members and fellow leaders responsively.
* **Attend and improve quarterly brigade leadership meetings** in which all current captains evaluate progress, make new action items, and check in on progress of initiatives.
* **Maintain and improve relationships with the Code for America Brigade network.** This means doing your best to attend at least one national meeting a year (they offer travel assistance) and being a supportive member of the wider Code for America brigade ecosystem.
* **Support our mission as a community liaison,** serving to grow brigade volunteer ranks, finding new external partnerships, and generally being a public face of the organization at tech events, community events, fund-raisers, etc.

## Leadership Phasing and Succession

A Captain serves in this capacity for **two consecutive years**. The first year of Captain-ship, you serve in a "junior" role, being effectively the "Supporting Captain". The following year, when the "Lead Captain" role retires, the previous year's "Support Captain" becomes the new "Lead Captain" with a new member stepping into the "Support Captain" role.
